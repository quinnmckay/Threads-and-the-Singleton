# Threads-and-the-Singleton
Threads and Singleton assignment for CIS-18

- I noticed with the Thread Demo and the Runnable Demo that the order was random everytime for when
the threads would be called and be executed.
- With the LazyInitialization, I noticed that there is a constructor for it, but there is nothing in it.
I don't fully understand why that is like that, but from what I had read about it is that it 
restricts instantiation.
